Nexus Repository Azure Cloud Storage Blobstore
==============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sonatype-nexus-community/nexus-blobstore-Azure-cloud.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sonatype-nexus-community/nexus-blobstore-Azure-cloud) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers](https://badges.gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers.svg)](https://gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This project adds [Azure Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.Azure.com/storage/) backed blobstores to Sonatype Nexus 
Repository 3.14 and later.  It allows Nexus Repository to store the components and assets in Azure Cloud instead of a
local filesystem.

Contribution Guidelines
-----------------------

Go read [our contribution guidelines](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get a bit more familiar with how
we would like things to flow.

Requirements
------------

* [Apache Maven 3.3.3+](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* [Java 8+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* Network access to https://repository.sonatype.org/content/groups/sonatype-public-grid

Also, there is a good amount of information available at [Bundle Development Overview](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/Bundle+Development#BundleDevelopment-BundleDevelopmentOverview)

Building
--------

To build the project and generate the bundle use Maven:

    mvn clean install
    
Integration Tests
-----------------

Integration tests can be found within src/test/java and have the class suffix `IT`. [Additional documentation is provided about how to configure and run them](src/test/resources/README.md)

Log in as admin and create a new blobstore, selecting 'Azure Cloud Storage' as the type.

The Fine Print
--------------

It is worth noting that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** by Sonatype, and is a contribution of ours
to the open source community (read: you!)

Remember:

* Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
* Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to Azure Cloud support
* DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in

Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all:

Have fun creating and using this plugin and the Nexus platform, we are glad to have you here!
